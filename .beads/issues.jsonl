Demystify AI through interactive projects that run in the browser. Think 'Instructables for AI' - touch it, play with it, understand it.\n\n## Philosophy\n- **Demystify AI** - Show what's really happening, not magic\n- **Browser-based** - WebLLM for chat, scikit-learn via Pyodide for ML\n- **Interactive** - Every concept has a 'try it yourself' component\n- **Progressive** - Build intuition before formal theory\n\n## Target Projects (7 mini-projects)\n1. **Chat with Sluggy** - Meet WebLLM, prompt basics\n2. **Sentiment Detector** - Is this text happy or sad?\n3. **Word Predictor** - N-grams and probability intro\n4. **Teach a Robot to Sort** - Simple classification visual\n5. **Recommendation Engine** - 'You might also like...'\n6. **AI Art Prompt Lab** - Creative prompting workshop\n7. **Build Your Own Chatbot** - Rules vs ML approaches\n\n## Technical Constraints\n- WebLLM for LLM projects (already integrated)\n- scikit-learn via Pyodide for ML demos\n- Visual/interactive explanations\n- No heavy model training (use pre-trained)\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Learners gain AI intuition before CS50 AI theory\n- Can explain 'how AI works' in simple terms\n- Confident to tackle CS50 AI curriculum","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"11763006+w4ester@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-18T23:44:39.524112-05:00","created_by":"Will F","updated_at":"2026-01-18T23:44:39.524112-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-gfk","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-18T23:45:43.787292-05:00","created_by":"Will F"},{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-7q9","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-18T23:46:14.437541-05:00","created_by":"Will F"},{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-sa9","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:00:12.154675-05:00","created_by":"Will F"},{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-t0z","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:02:13.046742-05:00","created_by":"Will F"},{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-6t4","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:03:02.642223-05:00","created_by":"Will F"},{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-4cb","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:03:48.461021-05:00","created_by":"Will F"},{"issue_id":"PL-xu8","depends_on_id":"PL-4sw","type":"parent","created_at":"2026-01-19T00:04:04.167608-05:00","created_by":"Will F"}]}
